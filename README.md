# WebWarriorKit

## Overview

WebWarriorKit is a versatile Python script designed to simplify the installation and setup of various web application testing environments. It automates the installation of popular vulnerable web applications and testing platforms, allowing you to quickly create controlled environments for security testing, learning, and experimentation.

## Features

- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**: Install DVWA, a deliberately vulnerable web application, to practice web security testing techniques.

- **bWAPP (Buggy Web Application)**: Set up bWAPP, another intentionally vulnerable web application, for hands-on security testing exercises.

- **Mutillidae**: Install Mutillidae, a free web application that contains vulnerabilities to help you learn and practice web security.

- **WebGoat**: Install and run WebGoat, a deliberately insecure web application for learning and testing security concepts and techniques.

- **OWASP Juice Shop**: Deploy OWASP Juice Shop, a modern and intentionally insecure web application, for realistic security testing scenarios.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu)
- Internet connectivity

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing `python WebWarriorKit.py` in your terminal.

2. Choose the web application you want to install by entering the corresponding number.

3. Follow the prompts and instructions to complete the installation.

4. Access the installed web application through a web browser or as indicated in the installation process.

## Disclaimer

These vulnerable web applications are meant for educational and testing purposes. Do not deploy them in production environments or on publicly accessible servers.
